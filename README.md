Hello

You will find the Odoo test for the Web Designer position I've done.

In my current job, we never use SCSS, so I have a little lack with that feature.
I know the basics but I prefer to deliver something working instead trying to upload a SCSS code & map that would maybe not work well.
I hope that will match your Art. 3 "Execute faster" :)

Obviously, if our future roads join together, it will be with pleasure for me to train and catch up my delay for SCSS (and more). I'm a fast learner so my delay won't be long.

I hope to hear you soon,
Have a great day,

Kimson Luong
